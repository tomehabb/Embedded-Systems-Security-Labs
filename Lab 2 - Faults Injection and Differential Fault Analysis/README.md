## Security Lab
This laboratory session provides a hands-on introduction to Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) techniques applied to an AES implementation. 
The AES algorithm, implemented in C, runs on an STM32 ARM-based microcontroller without any integrated countermeasures, making it a suitable target for fault injection experiments.
